## Research Areas 
### Physiological and ecological responses of crops to environmental conditions,<br>from germination to heading, grain filling, and harvest.
- Integrating ecophysiological insights with smart ag-tech
- Multi-disciplinary solutions for diverse production environments

<br>

## Research Themes

### Climate-smart crop production
- Crop phenological development in response to environmental drivers
- Stress mitigation under heat, low light, drought, flooding, and related climate extremes
