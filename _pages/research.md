## Research Vision

<h3 style="margin-top:0.6rem; margin-bottom:0.3rem; font-weight:800;">
  From Ecophysiological Understanding to Novel Agricultural Technologies
</h3>

<p style="margin-top:0.2rem; margin-bottom:1.2rem; font-style:italic; opacity:0.92;">
  - Deep ecophysiological understanding generates new questions and frameworks for applied agricultural technologies -
</p>


## Research Areas 

<h3 style="margin-top:0.6rem; margin-bottom:0.3rem; font-weight:800;">
  Physiological and ecological responses of crops to environmental conditions,<br>
  from germination to heading, grain filling, and harvest.
</h3>

## Research Themes

### Climate-smart crop production
- Crop phenological development in response to environmental drivers
- Stress mitigation under heat, low light, drought, flooding, and related climate extremes
- Biostimulant-based technologies and optimization

### Digital growth indicators and modeling
- Quantitative indicators for growth and development
- Predictive models for phenology and productivity

### Space agriculture (controlled environments)
- Edible biomass productivity in closed controlled environments
- Multi-harvest strategies using ratoon rice technologies
