## Crop Physiology Lab (CNU)

Crop Physiology Lab (Department of Crop Science, Chungnam National University) conducts research on climate-smart crop production and fundamental crop physiology. We develop digital growth indicators and modeling approaches to quantify crop growth, phenological development, and stress responses across field and controlled-environment conditions.

Our space agriculture research focuses on improving edible biomass productivity in closed controlled environments, including multi-harvest production strategies using ratoon rice technologies.

### Research Focus
- Climate-smart crop production (heat, low light, drought, salinity)
- Fundamental crop physiology (phenology, photosynthesis, carbon metabolism)
- Digital growth indicators and predictive modeling
- Space agriculture and controlled-environment crop production (ratoon rice)
